import { InjectionToken } from '@angular/core';

// this goes to the app.module
//declare let toastr:any

// TOASTR is an OBJECT - we created an object and as long we export this one and use this one to lookup in dependency injection no one can use the same, so no conflicts (different instance)
// example if we created a TOASTR_TOKEN with other lookup string
export let JQ_TOKEN = new InjectionToken<object>('jQuery');
// the ('toastr') is a token to lookup the toastr object inside dependency injection registry
// could have used any instead of Toastr, but this one is simple
